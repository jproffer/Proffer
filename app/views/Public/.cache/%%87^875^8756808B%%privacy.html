Any or all of the information we collect from you may be used in any of the following ways:<br /><br />

HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?<br /><br />

Tutorary uses security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information, when you place an order or access your personal information. All transactions are processed through our third party vendor, and sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. We never save your payment information; all information is disposed of following the completed transaction.<br /><br />

DO WE USE COOKIES?<br /><br />

Yes, Tutorary uses cookies to improve your visit to our services. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.<br /><br />

If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is sent to any website or accessed by a website, or you can choose to turn off all cookies using your browser settings, typically found in the Tools option. Turning your cookies off can result in some of your services on different websites, including ours, to work incorrectly and no longer save your login information for most sites. At this time, orders may not be successfully completed without the use of cookies; however, all concerns can be addressed via our Live Chat option from the homepage.<br /><br />

DO WE DISCLOSE ANY INFORMATION TO OUTSIDE PARTIES?<br /><br />

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect the rights, property, or safety of ourselves or others - as required by law or regulation. Non-personally identifiable visitor information may be used to demonstrate traffic, browser types, or even demographic information such as server location; however, your personal information is never part of this disclosure when used to determine website use.<br /><br />

CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT COMPLIANCE<br /><br />

We value your privacy, and have taken all necessary precautions to comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. Therefore, we will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent, or at all.<br /><br />
