HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?<br /><br />

Tutorary uses security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information, when you place an order or access your personal information.

We never save your payment information; all information is disposed of following the completed transaction.<br /><br />

DO WE USE COOKIES?<br /><br />

Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.<br /><br />

If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is sent to any website or accessed by a website, or you can choose to turn off all cookies using your browser settings, typically found in the Tools option. Turning your cookies off can result in some of your services on different websites, including ours, to work incorrectly and no longer save your login information for most sites. At this time, orders may not be successfully completed without the use of cookies; however, all concerns can be addressed via our Live Chat option from the homepage.<br /><br />
